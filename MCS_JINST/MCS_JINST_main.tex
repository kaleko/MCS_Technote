\section{Introduction and Motivation}\label{sec:intro}

MicroBooNE (Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment) is an experiment based at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) that uses a large Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) to investigate the excess of low energy events observed by the MiniBooNE experiment \cite{Aguilar-Arevalo:2013pmq} and to study neutrino-argon cross-sections. MicroBooNE is part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) physics program, along with two other LArTPCs: the Short Baseline Near Detector (SBND) and the Imaging Cosmic And Rare Underground Signal (ICARUS) detector. MicroBooNE also provides important research and development in terms of detector technology and event reconstruction techniques for future LArTPC experiments including DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment).\\

\end{figure}

The MicroBooNE detector is currently the largest LArTPC in the United States. It consists of a rectangular time projection chamber (TPC) with dimensions 2.6 m width $\times$ 2.3 m height $\times$ 10.4 m length located 470 m away from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) target. LArTPCs allow for precise three-dimensional reconstruction of particle interactions. The x-direction of the TPC corresponds to the drift coordinate, the y-direction is the vertical direction, and the z-direction is the direction along the beam. The amount of active liquid argon in the MicroBooNE TPC is 89 tons, with the total cryostat containing 170 tons of liquid argon.\\

Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and three wire planes with 3mm spacing at angles of 0, and $\pm$ 60 degrees with respect to the vertical are located in the TPC to aid with event reconstruction (Figure \ref{detector_fig}). In a neutrino interaction, a neutrino from the beam interacts with the argon and the charged outgoing child particles traverse the medium, losing energy and leaving an ionization trail. The resulting ionization electrons drift to the anode side of the TPC, containing the wire planes. The movement of electrons induces a current in the wires, which is used to create three distinct two-dimensional views of the event. Combining these wire signals with timing information from the PMTs allows for full three-dimensional reconstruction of the event.\\

The Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) is predominantly composed of muon neutrinos, which can undergo charge-current interactions in the TPC and produce muons. For muon tracks that are completely contained in the TPC, it is straightforward to calculate the momentum with a measurement of the length of the particle's track, or with calorimetric measurements. Around half of muons from BNB neutrino events in MicroBooNE are not fully contained in the TPC, and therefore using length-based calculations for these uncontained tracks is not a possibility. The only way to compute the energy of an outgoing three-dimensional track is by means of multiple coulomb scattering (MCS). \\

The phenomenon of multiple coulomb scattering (MCS) occurs when a charged particle enters a medium and undergoes electromagnetic scattering with the atomic nuclei. This scattering deviates the original trajectory of the particle within the material (Figure \ref{mcs_nocap_fig}). For a given energy, the scatters of a track-like particle (in terms of angular deflection relative to the track direction) form a gaussian distribution centered at zero with a standard deviation given by the Highland formula \cite{highland}: 

\begin{equation}
	\sigma_o^{HL}=\frac{13.6\  \text{MeV}}{p\beta c}z\sqrt{\frac{\ell}{X_0}}\Big[1+0.0038\text{ln}\Big(\frac{\ell}{X_0}\Big)\Big]
\end{equation}\label{highland_eqtn}

\noindent where $\beta$ is the ratio of the particle's velocity to the speed of light, $\ell$ is the distance traveled inside the material, $z$ is the magnitude of the charge of the particle, and $X_0$ is the radiation length of the target material (taken to be a constant 14 cm in liquid argon). In practice, a modified version of the Highland formula is used
\begin{equation}\label{modified_highland_eqtn}
\sigma_{o} = \sqrt{ (\sigma_o^{HL})^2 + (\sigma_o^{res})^2} = \sqrt{ (\frac{13.6\  \text{MeV}}{p\beta c}z\sqrt{\frac{\ell}{X_0}}\Big[1+0.0038\text{ln}\Big(\frac{\ell}{X_0}\Big)\Big])^2 + (\sigma_o^{res})^2 }
\end{equation}
where the formula is ``modified'' from the original Highland formula (Equation \ref{highland_eqtn}) in that it includes a detector-inherent angular resolution term $\sigma_o^{res}$ which is given a fixed value of 2 mrad which has been determined to be an acceptable value based on simulation studies.\\


With the Highland formula, the momentum of a track-like particle can be determined using only the 3D reconstructed track it produces in the detector, without any calorimetric information. The method by which this is done is described in detail in Section \ref{MCS_technique_section} and was originally described for use in a LArTPC on atmospheric muons by the ICARUS collaboration\cite{icarus_mcs_paper}.

\section{MCS Implementation Using the Maximum Likelihood Method}\label{MCS_technique_section}

This section describes exactly how the phenomenon of multiple coulomb scattering is leveraged to determine the momentum of a track-like particle reconstructed in a LArTPC. In general, the approach is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The three-dimensional track is broken up into segments of configurable length.
\item The scattering angles between consecutive segments are measured.
\item Those angles combined with the Highland formula (Equation \ref{highland_eqtn}) are used to build a likelihood that the particle has a specific momentum, taking into account energy loss in upstream segments of the track.
\item The momentum corresponding to the maximum likelihood is chosen to be the MCS computed momentum.
\end{enumerate}
Each of these steps are discussed in detail in the following subsections.\\

% For this analysis, a minimum start-to-end reconstructed track length of 100 cm was used. A minimum length is required to allow for sufficient scatters to measure the momentum. With 100 cm tracks and 10 cm segments (see Section \ref{track_segmentation_section}), twenty scattering measurements will ultimately be used to reconstruct the momentum of the particle (see Section \ref{scattering_angle_computation_section}).

\subsection{Track Segmentation and Scattering Angle Computation}\label{track_segmentation_and_scattering_angle_computation_section}
% The input to the track segmentation routine is a vector of ordered three-dimensional trajectory points (x,y,z) representing the reconstructed track. The points are ordered along the direction of the track, with the first point representing the start of the track, and the last point representing the end of the track. These trajectory points can be determined in a number of ways by different track reconstruction algorithms. In the case of this analysis, the track reconstruction algorithm is named ``pandoraNuPMA" which constructs these three-dimensional trajectory points by combining two-dimensional hits reconstructed from signals on the different wire planes along with timing information from the photomultiplier tubes to reconstruct the third dimension\cite{Marshall:2015rfa}. Note that the tracking resolution in the y- (vertical) and z- (beam) directions are determined by the wire plane spacings, while the resolution in the x- (drift) direction is determined by optical signal timing and is therefore the x- direction resolution is better than that of the y- and z- directions.\\

% Also input to the track segmentation routine is the desired segment length, which is a tunable parameter. In this note, segment lengths are always taken to be 10 cm (based on the findings of Appendix \ref{SegmentLength_MCBNBRecoTrack_section}) except where otherwise explicitly stated. 
Track segmentation refers to the subdivision of three-dimensional reconstructed trajectory points of a track within the TPC into portions of definite length. In this analysis, the tracks are automatically reconstructed by the ``pandoraNuPMA" projection matching algorithm which constructs the three-dimensional trajectory points by combining two-dimensional hits reconstructed from signals on the different wire planes along with timing information from the photomultiplier tubes to reconstruct the third dimension\cite{Marshall:2015rfa}. The segmentation routine begins at the start of the track, and iterates through the trajectory points in order, defining segment start and stop points based on the straight-line distance between them. There is no overlap between segments. Given the subset of the three-dimensional trajectory points that correspond to one ``segment" of the track, a three-dimensional linear fit is applied to the data points, weighing all trajectory points equally in the fit.\\

With the segments defined, the scattering angles between adjacent segments are computed. A coordinate transformation is performed such that the $z'$ direction is oriented along the direction of the first of the segment pair. The $x'$ and $y'$ are then defined such that all of $x'$, $y'$, and $z'$ are mutually orthogonal, as shown in Figure \ref{mcs_nocap_fig}. The scattering angles both in the $x'$ and $y'$ planes are then computed to be used by the MCS algorithm. Note that only the scattering angle in the $x'$ plane is drawn in Figure \ref{mcs_nocap_fig}.



% This routine within the MCS code takes as input the vector of length $n$ (where $n$ is the number of segments for the track) containing the direction cosines at the start of each segment. In general, the algorithm iterates over consecutive pairs of segments (the segmentation routine is described in Section \ref{track_segmentation_section}) and computes angular scatters between each, and stores them for later use by a future subroutine. This code is more complicated than just taking the dot product between consecutive direction cosines to find the total angular scatter between segments because the Highland formula is derived from scattering independently in the two directions orthogonal to the direction of the track. For this reason, this subroutine performs a coordinate transformation for each pair of segments such that the direction of first of the two segments is along the $z'$ direction, as drawn in Figure \ref{mcs_nocap_fig}. With the $z'$ direction defined as such, $x'$ and $y'$ directions are chosen such that all of $x'$, $y'$, and $z'$ are mutually orthogonal, again shown in Figure \ref{mcs_nocap_fig}\footnote{Note that at this point, all of $x'$, $y'$, and $z'$ are different than the detector coordinates, $x$, $y$, and $z$ which correspond to drift direction, vertical direction, and beam direction respectively.}. The scattering angles both in the $x'$ and $y'$ planes are then computed for each consecutive pairs of segments\footnote{Both of these scattering angles are used downstream in the MCS algorithm, and therefore the choice of $x'$ and $y'$ are not important.}. After this routine, a vector of length $2n$ is stored containing the scattering angles in the $x'$ plane as well as in the $y'$ plane. These scattering angles are what are input into the maximum likelihood routine to determine track momentum.


\subsection{Maximum Likelihood Theory}\label{likelihood_theory_section}

The normal probability distribution for the scattering angle in either the $x'$ or $y'$ direction, $\Delta\theta$ with an expected gaussian error $\sigma_o$ and mean $\mu_o$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
f_X(\Delta\theta) = (2\pi\sigma_o^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}exp(-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(\Delta\theta-\mu_o)^2}{\sigma_o^2})
\end{equation}

Here, $\mu_o$ is assumed to be zero, and $\sigma_o$ is the RMS angular deflection computed by the modified Highland formula (Equation \ref{modified_highland_eqtn}), which is a function of both the momentum and the length of that segment. Since energy is lost between segments along the track, $\sigma_o$ increases for each angular measurement along the track so we replace $\sigma_o$ with $\sigma_{o,j}$, where $j$ is an index representative of the segment. \newline

To get the likelihood, one takes the product of $f_X(\Delta\theta_j)$ over all $n$ of the $\Delta\theta_j$ segment-to-segment scatters along the track. Since the product of exponentials is just an exponential with the sum of the arguments, this product becomes
\begin{equation}
L((\sigma_{o,1})^2,...,(\sigma_{o,n})^2;\Delta\theta_1,...,\Delta\theta_n) = (2\pi)^\frac{-n}{2}\times\prod_{j=1}^{n}(\sigma_{o,j})^{-1} \times exp(-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(\frac{\Delta\theta_j}{\sigma_{o,j}})^2)
\end{equation}

In practice, rather than maximizing likelihood it is often more computationally convenient to instead minimize the negative log likelihood. Inverting the sign and taking the natural logarithm of the likelihood $L$ gives an expression that is related to a $\chi^2$
\begin{equation}\label{leo_llhd_eqtn}
-l(\mu_o;(\sigma_{o,1})^2,...,(\sigma_{o,n})^2;\Delta\theta_1,...,\Delta\theta_n) = -ln(L) = \frac{n}{2}ln(2\pi) + \sum_{j=1}^{n}ln(\sigma_{o,j}) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(\frac{\Delta\theta_j}{\sigma_{o,j}})^2
\end{equation}

% The negative log likelihood for one specific segment's angular scatter $\Delta\theta_j$ given an expected scattering RMS $\sigma_{o,j}$ is given by the following equation
% \begin{equation}\label{negative_llh_eqtn}
% -l(\mu_o, \sigma_{o,j}, \Delta\theta_j) = \frac{1}{2}ln(2\pi) + ln(\sigma_{o,j}) + \frac{1}{2}\frac{(\Delta\theta_j-\mu_o)^2}{(\sigma_{o,j})^2}
% \end{equation}

% In general, Equation \ref{negative_llh_eqtn} is evaluated for each segment in a track given a postulated full track momentum, and the sum of these terms is used to determine the likelihood that the postulated track momentum is correct for that track.

\subsection{Maximum Likelihood Implementation}\label{maximum_likelihood_section}

Given a set of angular deflections in the $x'$ and $y'$ planes for each segment as described in Section \ref{track_segmentation_and_scattering_angle_computation_section} a raster scan over postulated track momenta in steps of 1 MeV up to 7.5 GeV is computed and the one with the smallest negative log likelihood (Equation \ref{leo_llhd_eqtn}) is chosen as the final MCS momentum, with the minimum allowable momentum being the range-based momentum (see Section \ref{Range_Energy_Validation_section} for validation that using range-based momentum in this way is valid). Note that Equation \ref{leo_llhd_eqtn} includes a $\sigma_{o,j}$ term which changes for each consecutive segment because their energies are decreasing. The energy of the $j$th segment is given by

\begin{equation}\label{segment_E_equation}
E_{j} = E_t - k_{cal}*N_{upstream}*l_{seg}
\end{equation}

where $k_{cal}$ is the minimally ionizing energy constant given to be $2.105 \frac{MeV}{cm}$ in liquid argon\cite{MIPenergysource}, $N_{upstream}$ is the number of segments upstream of this particular segment, and $l_{seg}$ is the segmentation length. This definition of $E_j$ therefore takes into account energy loss along the track. This value of segment energy is converted to a momentum, $p$, with the usual energy-momentum relation, assuming the muon mass, which is used to predict the RMS angular scatter for that segment ($\sigma_o$) by way of Equation \ref{modified_highland_eqtn}.
