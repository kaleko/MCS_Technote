\section{Introduction and Motivation}

MicroBooNE (Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment) is an experiment based at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) that uses a large Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) to investigate the excess of low energy events observed by the MiniBooNE experiment \cite{Aguilar-Arevalo:2013pmq} and to study neutrino-argon cross-sections. MicroBooNE is part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) physics program, along with two other LArTPCs: the Short Baseline Near Detector (SBND) and the Imaging Cosmic And Rare Underground Signal (ICARUS) detector. 

The MicroBooNE detector is currently the largest LArTPC in the United States. It consists of a rectangular time projection chamber (TPC) with dimensions 2.3 m $\times$ 2.6 m $\times$ 10.4 m located 470 m away from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) target. Time projection chambers, filled with a gas or liquid volume, are used to analyze particle interactions in three dimensions. The x-direction of the TPC corresponds to the drift coordinate, the y-direction is the vertical direction, and the z-direction is the direction along the beam. The amount of active liquid argon in the TPC is 86 tons, with the total cryostat containing 170 tons of liquid argon. Liquid argon is chosen to fill the volume for a variety of reasons: argon contains a high number of nucleons, which allows for a greater rate of interactions with particles within the medium; argon ionizes easily; it produces scintillation light which is not reabsorbed; it has a high electron lifetime; and it is inexpensive.

Photomultiplier tubes and three wire planes are located in the TPC to aid with event reconstruction (Fig. 1). In an event, a neutrino interacts with the argon and its charged interaction products move through the medium, losing energy and leaving an ionizing trail. The resulting electrons drift to the anode side of the TPC, containing the wire planes, away from the negatively charged cathode plate on the opposite side. The movement of electrons induces a current in the wires, which is used to reconstruct the event from these signals in three dimensions.

One of the aims of MicroBooNE is to explore neutrino oscillations. For the two neutrino case, the probability that a neutrino with an initial flavor $\alpha$ will be observed as a neutrino with a different flavor $\beta$ when measured is: 

\begin{equation}
    P_{\alpha \rightarrow \beta}=\text{sin}^2(2\theta)\text{sin}^2(\frac{\Delta m^2 L}{4E})
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\theta$ is the mixing angle, $L$ is the distance from the neutrino source to the detector, $E$ is the energy of the neutrino, and $\Delta m^2$ is the neutrino squared mass difference. $\theta$ and $\Delta m^2$ are the two free parameters of interest in the above equation. The probability $P$ can be determined through a measurement of observed neutrino events compared to expected events, the distance $L$ is readily determined and constant, and $E$ can be computed from the energies of the neutrino's interaction products. 

The BNB is predominantly composed of muon neutrinos, which can undergo charge-current interactions in the TPC and produce muons. For muon tracks that are completely contained in the TPC, it is easy to calculate the momentum through the length of the particle's track. Around half of muons tracks are not fully contained in the TPC, however. Using length-based calculations for these uncontained tracks is not a possibility. There is a way to account for the amount of energy deposited per segment of track, however, and use this information to predict the initial energy of the muon, if one takes into consideration the effects of multiple coulomb scattering on the particle.

The phenomenon of multiple coulomb scattering (MCS) occurs when a charged particle enters a medium and undergoes electromagnetic scattering with the atoms. This scattering deviates the original trajectory of the particle within the material (Fig. 2).  The collection of these deflections within the material form a Gaussian distribution with mean at 0 and standard deviation given by the Highland formula \cite{highland}:  

\begin{equation}
	\theta_0=\frac{13.6\  \text{MeV}}{p\beta c}z\sqrt{\frac{\ell}{X_0}}\Big[1+0.0038\text{ln}\Big(\frac{\ell}{X_0}\Big)\Big]
\end{equation}\label{highland_eqtn}

\noindent where $\beta$ is the ratio of the particle's velocity to the speed of light, $\ell$ is the distance traveled inside the material, and $X_0$ is the radiation length of the target material. The particle's momentum, $p$, can be found if the angular deflections of the particle inside the material--and thus the standard deviation $\theta_0$ of these angular deflections--are known.
